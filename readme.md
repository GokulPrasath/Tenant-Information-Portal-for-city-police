 Tenant Information portal for City police
 
         The tenant information portal system is a crucial web application where every house owner and tenant must  provide their  registered agreements details to the police.
        With the safety being prime concern, it is mandatory for the tenants to provide full information of themselves and the owner to the nearest police station.
         The police can login the portal using the required information and can upload all the information about the tenant and owner in the portal which gets stored onto the database.
          The higher official from the police department views all the uploaded information by the police  according to the station area.
          The portal provides easy usability to the higher officials as well as police.
